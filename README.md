# DDD-blue-book-collaborative-reading

This repo mainly uses [Github Discussions](https://github.com/Mehdi-H/DDD-blue-book-collaborative-reading/discussions/2)
in order to discuss about Eric Evans' blue
book [Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/domain-driven-design-tackling/0321125215/).

You'll find a discussion dedicated for each chapter, in which you can ask question to the rest of the community of
readers, or simply share anything you find insightful.

You can open a merge request to add anything you find interesting regarding the topic of the book or DDD in general to
this repo.

> ⚠️ No merge request containing exact extracts of the book will be accepted in order to avoid copyright infringements.
